# NOTICE:

If you're interested in the Hypixel API portions of this bot a much more improved version is available [here](https://github.com/zikeji/node-hypixel).

# skyblock-utilities-bot

Source code for the SkyBlockZ Utilties Discord bot. Archived as the primary dependency (Klasa) shutdown discontinued development. Source code doesn't work out of the box and some refactoring is required to get it working. No support is provided by me for the code, you can review the package.json for some insight into launching it. The ecosystem.config.example.js is a PM2 ecosystem file as well.
